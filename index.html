  <h1>My pet parrot
  </h1>
  <p>This story is about a pet parrot that I once owned.</p>
  <p> Coco was its name. lived for close to 17 years
    if not more (I'll explain) </p>
  <p> Before going any further, we ought to know more about parrots.</p>
  <h2> What are parrots? </h2>
  <p>According to Wikipedia, parrots (aka <strong><em>psittacines </em>
  </strong>) are birds made up of about 393 species commonly found in tropical
  and subtropical regiions. </p>
  <p>They most distinctive features are their vivid and multi-colours, curved
  beak and upright stance. </p>
  <p>However, their most interesting characteristic in my opinion is their
    intelligence. These birds are widely known for their ability to mimic
    humans as well as a panoply of sounds. </p>

  <h2> Parrot </h2>
  <p> Back to my story. Coco was not my pet per se. It was more of a family pet.
    I can not remember him not being around. From what hear, he was brought a
    couple of years before I was born. </p>
